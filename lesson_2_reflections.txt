What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

		Git creates an empty repository and the needed structure to govern it.
		You have to start somewhere.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
		The staging area contains whichever version of the file you "add"ed, while the
		working directory contains whatever the current version of the file is.  The
		repository doesn't yet contain the file, but will contain the one in the
		staging area when it gets committed.
		
		The staging area allows you to take a snapshot of a file but continue working on it
		until you're ready to commit.
