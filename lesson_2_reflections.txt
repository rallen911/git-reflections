What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

		Git creates an empty repository and the needed structure to govern it.
		You have to start somewhere.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
		The staging area contains whichever version of the file you "add"ed, while the
		working directory contains whatever the current version of the file is.  The
		repository doesn't yet contain the file, but will contain the one in the
		staging area when it gets committed.
		
		The staging area allows you to take a snapshot of a file but continue working on it
		until you're ready to commit.
		
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
		As you finish a logical change you can add it to the staging area.
		
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?
		If you're working on a new feature or doing significant rework and don't want to 
		roadblock work on the tip.  Branches help by allowing you to work along side the tip work
		before merging the branch back to the tip.
		
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
		Diagrams can show you the relationship between branches and what might be contained 
		in those branches.  It can also help you understand what a message from git is telling
		you.

What is the result of merging two branches together?
		The resulting branch has a combination of added and removed lines that reflects
		what was done in each individual branch.
		
Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
		The arrows show the source of what was merged.
