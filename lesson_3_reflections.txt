When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    If you wanted to share your content with another person or group.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
		The remote repository may have other people working in it and committing changes
		that you don't necessarily want.
