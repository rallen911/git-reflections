When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    If you wanted to share your content with another person or group.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
		The remote repository may have other people working in it and committing changes
		that you don't necessarily want.
		
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
		A branch is a particular line of development within a repository.
		A clone is a complete copy of a repository made using "git clone".
		A fork is a complete copy of a repository made using GitHub.

When would you use one instead of another?
		I would use a branch for developing something within a repository.
		I would use a clone to make a complete copy of a repository on my computer.
		I would use a fork to copy someone else's repository that I don't have change access to.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
		You can know how different your local master is from the origin master.
